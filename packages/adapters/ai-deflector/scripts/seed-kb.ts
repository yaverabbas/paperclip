/**
 * Seed AI Deflector KB SQLite from built-in high-confidence patterns.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm --filter @paperclipai/adapter-ai-deflector seed:kb
 *   AI_DEFLECTOR_KB_PATH=/path/to/kb.sqlite pnpm --filter @paperclipai/adapter-ai-deflector seed:kb
 *
 * Phase 0 mining notes (2026-08-15 against goc.yaaver.com, GET-only):
 * - AIP: 8601 issues (1164 stranded_issue_recovery)
 * - ONS: 2261 issues (616 stranded_issue_recovery)
 * - Safe auto-resolve heuristic: originKind=stranded_issue_recovery + title
 *   Recover stalled/missing + origin status done|cancelled (~575 AIP cases).
 * - Wazir watchlog/kb mined for known bugs; list-endpoint staleness is ops noise,
 *   not a safe issue auto-resolve pattern, so it was not seeded.
